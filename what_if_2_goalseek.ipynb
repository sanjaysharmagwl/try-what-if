How do we tell `root_scalar` which one of the inputs (e.g. demand) is the one we want to search over and that we want all the other arguments to remain fixed at specific values? This is a job for something known as a [partial function](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Partial_functions). The idea is to create a new function object that is based on an existing function, but with some of the function's inputs set to fixed values. To create partial functions, we need to use the `partial` function from the `functools` library. Unfortunately, while this initially seemed easy, we quickly ran into problems. \n",

    "### Adding a `goal_seek` function\n",
    "As mentioned earlier in this notebook, there were a bunch of issues that popped up in trying to use SciPy's root finding functions with the non-OO model. For the OO model, it felt like I'd end up with similar problems in trying to write some sort of generic wrapper that would create functions to pass into things like `root_scalar`. Instead, I decided to simply bypass SciPy and write my own root finder that I could tailor to our goal seeking problem. When I say \"write\", I mean find a good implementation that someone has already done and tweak it. \n",

    "For example, https://github.com/patrickwalls/mathematical-python/ has nice implementations of various root finding methods. It was a pretty simple matter to adapt the [bisection function he wrote in this notebook](https://github.com/patrickwalls/mathematical-python/blob/master/roots-optimization/bisection.ipynb) to use in my `goal_seek` function.
